<p>If you are a Data Journalist looking to  improve your <strong>coding skills</strong>, or you work as a developer giving support in a <strong>newsroom</strong>, you arrived to the right place.  </p>

<p>This is a repository of articles and tutorials about doing data journalism using Python technologies. The articles presented here, apart from analysing data to present some facts about the current, past, and sometimes future world situation, will link to <strong>programming instructions</strong> explaining how to repeat the analysis by yourself. We live in a world where governments and the media, more often than not, serve the interests of a few. Our belief is that to empower people to do their own analysis and arrive to conclusions based on facts (data), is a way to make us all more aware and strong as a society.  </p>

<p>The programming instructions will be given as web <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython#Notebook">Notebooks</a> for the Python programming language. This is an ideal way of sharing code combined with textual explanations, charts, images, etc. But why Python? Well, we will sometimes use other technologies (mainly R but also JavaScript or Spark) but we think that Python has some characteristics that makes it a good environment for Data Journalism:  </p>

<ul>
<li>It is a modern programming language, very clean and expressive, that promotes simplicity and elegance.<br>
</li>
<li>It can be used to write scripts (as we will use it most of the time) and also to build complex software systems.<br>
</li>
<li>There are lots of extensions (i.e. libraries) to perform all sorts of tasks, not just data analysis and visualisation ones, but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">web development</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>, etc.<br>
</li>
<li>You can share your code as notebooks!<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So our hope is that while finding our articles analysis and conclusions interesting, you will also learn how to repeat and extend them yourself and arrive to aditional conclusions.  </p>

<p>My name is <a href="http://jadianes.me/">Jose A. Dianes</a> and I am a software engineer, PhD. During years I have been involved in all sorts of software projects including real-time systems, web enterprise systems, and bioinformatics. Eventually I arrived to data analysis and products, where I solve scalability problems and deliver producst that provide actionable knowledge.  </p>
